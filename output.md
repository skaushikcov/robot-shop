Ran the Application locally on my Mac using docker compose instructions:

Used the website to get a License Key to run the application:

LaunchInstanceID=FBFE823F-0DF2-42A3-8CF8-FF384DB4297E

- docker compose pull
- docker compuse up --detach (to run the containers in the background)
- docker ps -a (to verify if the containers are up)
- navigated to http://localhost:8080 to see the application.
